**Driverboard for 7T MRI (Philips Achieva)**

This project contains a driverboard made for our 7T Philips Achieva MRI system. It has been tested inside the magnetic field of the 7T MRI. The design and subsequent drawing has been done in Kicad 5.1.5.



It has been made by the coil-lab of the High Field MRI Group of the UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, where we make hardware to support our researchers. We are part of a research group which means we feel the need to open up some of our designs to whomever can make use of it, to further the research of MRI applications.

Gerber and BOM production files for the lastest _field tested_ version of the PCB can be found in the 'Releases' page, or by following [this link](/releases/latest). 
You can also make your own production files by downloading the Kicad project and generating them, but these are not guaranteed to have been field tested.
